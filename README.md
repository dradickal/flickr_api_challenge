# flickr_api_challenge

## Flickr API documentation 
* [flickr.photos.search request](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html)
* [build the photo urls](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html)

## ToDo List
- [x] On page load, below script is executed.  Instead, send the request when user clicks button#flickr_search
- [x] I would rather have this user input be the 'text' that we send with the flickr request
- [ ] Parse this data to get the info we need for displaying the photos
- [ ] I would like to see a grid of the photos as small thumbnails since we want the page to load as quickly as possible
- [ ] When the user clicks on a thumbnail, we should load the original photo for the user to see
- [ ] I prefer when we show the original photo, we don't have to navigate away from the page and force the user to click the back button when done (hint: Ajax, Modal)

## Extra Credit
- [ ] Make this look good!
