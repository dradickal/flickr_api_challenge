// Flickr API documentation for flickr.photos.search request https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html


//TODO On page load, below script is executed.  Instead, send the request when user clicks button#flickr_search

//TODO Parse this data to get the info we need for displaying the photos
//TODO I would like to see a grid of the photos as small thumbnails since we want the page to load as quickly as possible
//TODO When the user clicks on a thumbnail, we should load the original photo for the user to see
//TODO IMPORTANT! This documentation will help you build the photo urls from the data response: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html
//TODO I prefer when we show the original photo, we don't have to navigate away from the page and force the user to click the back button when done (hint: Ajax, Modal)
//EXTRA_CREDIT Make this look good!
